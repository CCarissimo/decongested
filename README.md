# DeCongested: learning to share for self-organized logistics

## Overview
DeCongested is a repository built and maintained by the Computational Social Science group at ETHZ, supported by the ’Co-Evolving City Life - CoCi’ project through the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 833168). 

The main research question guiding this research is:
> How can self-organization and resilience principles be used in a way that makes cities more sustainable?

This particular project focuses on transport and logistics networks and studies the ability of learning agents to leverage self-organization and continuously learn to share networked resources. This investigation involves frontier research at the intersection of game theory, machine learning, traffic science, and complex systems.

### Repository Contents
- dqn_agent contains the functions to run a Deep Q-Learning model
- dqn_grid runs a DQN agent in the specified environment
- dqn_grid_results is a helper jupyter notebook designed to plot and analyze the results from runs from dqn_grid
- environment contains the environment classes that implement the decentralized and asynchronous multi-player atomic routing simulation 


## Background

### Routing, route choice, congestion games

### Circular economics, logistics  

### Reinforcement learning
